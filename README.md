# Mask_Detection
Here I have done a mini project which detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. Here I have given a data set of images to train where it has pictures of different persons wearing the face mask and not wearing the face mask. I have used python libraries:Tensor flow, keras,sklearn,numpy.
